## Add-ons in this repository

### Advanced Kodi Settings

My google tv does not allow me to edit/create the "advancedsettings.xml" file and since it has several issues
related to out-of-sync audio if passthrough is used, I need kodi settings recently added. That is why 
I created this add-on by forking https://github.com/abratchik/script.unlock.advancedsettings and adding the settings I need.
The sources of the add-on can be found in the following folder:

[advancedsettings](https://github.com/cridemichel/repository.cridemichel/tree/master/leia/advancedsettings)

Once you have installed my repository (see above), you can install the add-on called "advancedsettings" (actual version: 1.0.6)
by navigating to "System/Add-ons/repository.cridemichel/Program add-ons".

# Step-by-step installation of "advancedsettings" add-on

  1.  Download [this file](https://github.com/cridemichel/repository.cridemichel/files/14320068/repository.cridemichel-1.0.3.zip)
  2.  Navigate to System/Add-ons/Install from the zip file and specify the file downloaded on the previous step.
  3.  Navigate to System/Add-ons/repository.cridemichel/Program add-ons, click on "Unlock Kodi Advanced Settings" and install it.
