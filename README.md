## Add-ons in this repository

### Advanced Kodi Settings

My google tv does not allow me to edit/create the "advancedsettings.xml" file and since it has several issues
related to out-of-sync audio if passthrough is used, I need kodi settings recently added. That is why 
I created this add-on by forking https://github.com/abratchik/script.unlock.advancedsettings and adding the settings I need.
The sources of the add-on can be found in the following folder:

[advancedsettings](https://github.com/cridemichel/repository.cridemichel/tree/master/leia/advancedsettings)

Once you have installed my repository, you can install the add-on called "advancedsettings" (actual version: 1.0.6)
